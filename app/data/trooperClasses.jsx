        desc: 'Stormtroopers (STs)—also known as Imperial stormtroopers and colloquially referred to as "bucketheads"—were the elite shock troops of the Galactic Empire, and were part of the Stormtrooper Corps, an independent military branch operating under the Imperial Army. These elite, obedient and zealous soldiers wore armor consisting of white plastoid plates over a black body glove, and their standard issue weapon was the E-11 medium blaster rifle. In addition to the standard variant trooper, various specialized units such as scout troopers and snowtroopers comprised the ranks of the corps. Alongside Imperial-class Star Destroyers and TIE fighters, stormtroopers served as reminders of the absolute power of the Empire. In addition, stormtroopers would serve with the regular infantry to enforce oppressive rule over the galaxy.',

The army comprised the children of the Sith Eternal, a cult that revered the dark side of the Force. While Sith troopers were named after the Jedi Order's fallen ancient rival, the Sith Order, they were not Force-sensitive like their namesake. Nevertheless, they shared the cultists' devotion to the Sith religion. Taking inspiration from the Sith legacy that was built on fear and death, the armor worn by Sith troopers was red like Sith lightsaber blades and the Emperor's Royal Guard. They were the culmination of the Contingency created by Darth Sidious—Dark Lord of the Sith and Galactic Emperor—whose goal was to return the galaxy to a dark age of a thousand years past, under the eternal reign of a new Sith Empire.",
